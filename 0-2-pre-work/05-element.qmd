title: "Communication in a chat"
---

Emails are not a very quick, responsive way of communication. We avoid them by prioritising other channels.

We want to communicate through a chat client called Element, providing the open source, free-of-charge Slack-like experience.

You can reach out to the course instructor and other students any time, and we have a way to stay in touch beyond the course itself. 

To set it up, please follow the steps below:

1.  Download and install Element: https://element.io/download. It is available on Linux, Mac OS, and Windows.

2.  Open the Element app on your device.

3.  Click **Sign in**

4.  In the Homeserver section, click **Edit**

6.  Sign in with your **ETH username** and **ETH password**

7.  Verify your device by creating a security key and store it securely. You will need the security key for adding another devices or logging back in on the same device.

8.  Welcome! Let the course instructor know (a last time by email) that you joined Element. He will invite you to the room for this course.
