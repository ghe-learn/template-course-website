Additionally, we will demonstrate how GitHub can serve as both a project management tool and a publishing platform using GitHub Pages.\nWhile the course will introduce commonly used tools in software development, they will not be explained in great detail. Instead, the goal is to expose learners to the tools and concepts, requiring openness to new ideas."

Except your username. You might want to give that some thought.\nA few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other:\n\nIncorporate your actual name! People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.\nReuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.\nPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.\nShorter is better than longer.\nBe as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.\nMake it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.\nAvoid words laden with special meaning in programming.\nAvoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen -.\n\nYou can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username/\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep : Setup a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)\nHere are the step-by-step instructions to set up a GitHub personal access token:\n\nLog in to your GitHub account.\nClick on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the page.\nSelect “Settings” from the dropdown menu.\nIn the left sidebar, click on “Developer settings”.\nClick on “Personal access tokens”.\nClick on “Tokens (classic)”.\nClick on “Generate new token” and from the dropdown menu select “Generate new token (classic)”.\nIn the “Note” field, give your token the name: GITHUB_PAT\nUnder Expiration, select “No expiration”\nUnder “Select scopes”, select: repo, workflow, user\nClick on “Generate token”.\nYour personal access token will be displayed on the screen. Copy it and store it in a safe place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\n\nTreat your access tokens like passwords and keep them secure (e.g. a password managing software)."
