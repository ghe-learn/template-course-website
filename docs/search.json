However, choosing tools for these tasks can be difficult. This course aims to guide researchers through these challenges by introducing a workflow that utilizes Git, GitHub, and the Quarto scientific and technical publishing system for collaborative scientific writing.\n\n\n\nThis course has the following learning objectives\n\nLearn to use the Quarto file format and the RStudio IDE visual editing mode to produce scholarly documents with citations, footnotes, cross-references, figures, and tables.\nExplain the differences between files written in markup languages like markdown (.md) and those in proprietary file formats like .docx.\nUtilize an exported library from Zotero in Better BibTex Format to create an automated reference list in your scientific documents.\nInteract with Git version control and GitHub through the RStudio IDE.\nCollaborate with other researchers using the GitHub issue tracker and project management board to organize tasks and streamline communication.\nPublish a public website using GitHub Pages to share research with a broader audience.\n\n\n\n\nThis course offers researchers a hands-on opportunity to learn open source tools and platforms that are accessible beyond institutional employment. The participatory live coding teaching technique involves an instructor writing and narrating code as they teach, and inviting learners to write and execute the same code.\nTopics covered include:\n\nScientific communication.\nReproducible research (open research, version control, licensing).\nCollaboration through Git and GitHub.\n\nDuring the course, participants will learn how to use the Quarto file format to prepare various scholarly documents, including slides, scientific articles, books, and websites. Additionally, we will demonstrate how GitHub can serve as both a project management tool and a publishing platform using GitHub Pages.\nWhile the course will introduce commonly used tools in software development, they will not be explained in great detail. Instead, the goal is to expose learners to the tools and concepts, requiring openness to new ideas.\n\n\n\nA public website is in preparation.\n\n\n\nPrior experience in a programming language is not required for this course, but learners who have worked with data science tools such as R, RStudio IDE, Jupyter Notebooks, Python, or VS Code may have an advantage and gain the most from the material.\nPrior to the course, learners are expected to have:\n\nA laptop with internet connection and one of Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge (just not the Internet Explorer)\nA registered account on GitHub: https://github.com/\nA registered ORCID iD: https://orcid.org/\nA registered account on Zotero: https://www.zotero.org/user/register\nRead the following paper: https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510\n\nTwo weeks before the course begins, the instructor will contact registered participants to provide a reminder about the prerequisites."
