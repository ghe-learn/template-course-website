The participatory live coding teaching technique involves an instructor writing and narrating code as they teach, and inviting learners to write and execute the same code.\nTopics covered include:\n\nScientific communication.\nReproducible research (open research, version control, licensing).\nCollaboration through Git and GitHub.\n\nDuring the course, participants will learn how to use the Quarto file format to prepare various scholarly documents, including slides, scientific articles, books, and websites. Additionally, we will demonstrate how GitHub can serve as both a project management tool and a publishing platform using GitHub Pages.\nWhile the course will introduce commonly used tools in software development, they will not be explained in great detail. Instead, the goal is to expose learners to the tools and concepts, requiring openness to new ideas."
