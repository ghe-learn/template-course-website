Additionally, we will demonstrate how GitHub can serve as both a project management tool and a publishing platform using GitHub Pages.\nWhile the course will introduce commonly used tools in software development, they will not be explained in great detail. Instead, the goal is to expose learners to the tools and concepts, requiring openness to new ideas."
