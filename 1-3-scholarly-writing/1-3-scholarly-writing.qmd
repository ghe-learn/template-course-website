## What's a Citation?

::: {.incremental}

- Inequality underpins waste management systems, structuring who can or cannot access services [@kalina2023rich].
- Many visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services [@tilley2021].
- In @tilley2021, the authors describe how visitors still expect a personal pick-up, despite the availability of taxi services.

::: 

::: {.notes}
**Explanation**
A citation is a reference to the source of information used in your research. Any time you directly quote, paraphrase, or summarize the essential elements of someone else's idea in your work, an in-text citation should follow. For example, in APA style, a citation might look like this: (Tilley and Kalina, 2021). 

**Analogy**
Think of a citation as a signpost on a road trip. It tells you where the information came from and points you in the direction of the full details (the destination), which can be found in the reference list.
