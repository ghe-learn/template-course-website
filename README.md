## Abstract

As the expectations of researchers increase, publishing reproducible
scientific articles becomes essential. However, choosing tools for these
tasks can be difficult. This course aims to guide researchers through
these challenges by introducing a workflow that utilizes Git, GitHub,
and the Quarto scientific and technical publishing system for
collaborative scientific writing.
